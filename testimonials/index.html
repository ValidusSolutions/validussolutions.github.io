				Our experience with Validus Solutions could not have been any better. They invested the time to fully understand our project prior to starting and hosted weekly update meetings to keep the project on track and keep us apprised of the project status. We were always treated like we were their most important client.

				Michael was crucial in helping our team overcome the steep learning associated with WPF and XAML development. He was forced to work remotely from the majority of the team, yet he was still able to collaborate, instruct, and mentor team members in the U.S. and India on the complexities of WPF. He largely lead by example, producing and documenting screens that were both immediately valuable to our product owners, and also great examples of "best practices" in how to work with WPF for our developers. Michael even went above and beyond to produce some screencasts for the client, which enabled offshore and new developers to learn XAML and WPF on their own time, after he had completed the project. Michael drastically acclerated the timeline of our development on this project, we would work with him again in a heartbeat.
